Harpy is a mobile app that I am currently developing as my final year project.

It is a React Native based app, designed with a focus on helping users get to sleep and fixing sleeping patterns.

The main features of the app will consist of an audio track player and sleep and wakeup notification assistance.

### Due to be finished by the 18th of May

## What am I using to make it?

I'm currently using Figma, Notion and FlowMapp to design and organise my project.

For development I have been using React Native (with expo), Firebase and Redux.
