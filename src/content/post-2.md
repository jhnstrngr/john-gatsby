"is gender binary?" is an independent university project where we had to develop an artistic concept based on machine learning and needed to be inspired by a project made by the art and technology research lab based in Plymouth; i-Dat.

For my research I was largely inspired by the project Women Reclaiming AI [womenreclaimingai.com](https://womenreclaimingai.com/), a collaborative AI voice assistant made to reclaim the voices of women in the development of AIs, through artistic protest activism.

I decided to approach the topic of gender and whether or not it is something that is binary. I did this by using a machine learning API to show a user what gender they are on a large scale. Based on the tests I made using it, it demonstrated that people who presented themselves as female or male mainly got those results, regardless of their birth sex. Which in my opinion helps possible demonstrate the fluidity of gender.

The project is live at [isgender.io](https://www.isgender.io/) and the code is available at [my repo](https://github.com/jhnstrngr/non-binary).

You can test the AI yourself by using a camera and waiting for the results that it returns and read the information available on the website.
